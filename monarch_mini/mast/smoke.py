"""Multi-machine smoke test for minimonarch over QUIC (TLS-encrypted).

Topology: a single root node connects to N worker nodes. Each worker *serves*
a quic:// listener; the root *joins* (connects out to) every worker. Once all
workers are connected each timed round exercises two message patterns:

  * *direct*: the root sends every worker a ping and each replies with its own
    identity (a star of independent round-trips through the root).
  * *ring*: the root wires each worker to its successor (the last worker back to
    the root), then injects a token at the first worker carrying an integer count.
    Each worker logs the count it saw and forwards count+1 to its next hop, so the
    token threads the whole ring hop-by-hop and returns to the root as the worker
    count. This exercises worker-to-worker routing, not just root round-trips.

Every phase is timed. Every message carries its type as a header part (see the
``H_*`` constants) so dispatch is an exact header match, never a payload sniff.

Worker IPs are not known until runtime and we never use DNS: the root is given
the worker addresses directly on the command line (or, on MAST, via an env var)
and dials them by IPv6 address.

Usage:

    # On each worker machine (binds all interfaces on PORT):
    python smoke.py --worker --port 26600

    # On the root machine, given the worker addresses:
    python smoke.py --root "[2401:db00::1]:26600" "[2401:db00::2]:26600"

TLS: the quic transport reads its material from MM_QUIC_CERT / MM_QUIC_KEY /
MM_QUIC_CA. Both ends present a certificate. The client verifies the server
against the CA for the fixed name "monarch-mini", and the server requires a
clientAuth certificate from the CA. A single dual-purpose cert/key/ca set works
on every machine regardless of its IP -- no per-host certificate signing and no
CA private key distribution is required. See ``ensure_quic_certs``.
