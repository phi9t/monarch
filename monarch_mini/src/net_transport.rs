//! Protocol-independent connection transport, generic over a [`Net`].
//!
//! A connection's coroutines bring up the connection's streams, produce a
//! [`ConnectionTransport`] for the data stream, and hand it to the command loop via
//! `Command::TransportConnected`; the data reader forwards every decoded frame back
//! as a `ConnectionAction`. Establishment policy (identity exchange, hello, liveness
//! reporting) lives in the command loop and is identical across transports. Wire
//! framing is shared (see [`crate::framing`]).
//!
//! ## Two streams per connection
//!
//! Every connection carries a data/control stream (index 0) and a heartbeat stream
//! (index 1). A single reliable, in-order stream head-of-line-blocks everything queued
//! behind a large message — including heartbeats, whose whole job is to keep flowing
//! while data does. So we put heartbeats on their **own** stream, separate from the
//! data/control stream; the heartbeat stream is given a higher send priority
//! ([`PRIORITY_HEARTBEAT`]), so a beat is packed ahead of queued data even under a full
//! congestion window.
//!
//! The heartbeat stream is materialized lazily (see [`crate::net`]): a message-only
//! gateway side channel never opens it. A parent/child link always heartbeats, so it
//! opens the stream off the establishment path — the first beat never delays either
//! establishment or serve-pairing.
//!
//! ## Liveness
//!
//! A protocol like quic runs in userspace over an unreliable datagram, so there is
//! no file-descriptor close to signal a lost peer. Instead an application-level
//! **bidirectional heartbeat** runs on the heartbeat stream (see
//! [`crate::heartbeat`]); a clean drop still finishes both streams so the peer
//! also observes EOF — the heartbeat is the backstop for the unclean cases.
