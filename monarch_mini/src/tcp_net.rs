//! TCP implementation of the [`Net`] transport seam — the cross-region fallback.
//!
//! QUIC runs over UDP, which is silently packet-filter-dropped across regions, so a
//! devserver can only reach same-region QUIC workers. A TLS-over-TCP flow is what the
//! cross-region enforcer clears, so `tcp://` reaches workers in any region. It reuses
//! the same TLS material as quic (`MM_QUIC_CERT`/`MM_QUIC_KEY`/`MM_QUIC_CA`). The client
//! verifies the server certificate against the CA for the fixed name [`SERVER_NAME`],
//! while the server verifies the client's `clientAuth` certificate against the CA.
//!
//! ## kTLS, with a userspace fallback
//!
//! When the kernel supports it, every socket is upgraded to **kTLS** immediately after
//! its rustls handshake: the negotiated secrets are handed to the kernel (via the
//! `ktls` crate), so the AES-GCM record crypto runs in-kernel and the data path keeps
//! TSO — one sender core can then drive tens of Gbps, unlike userspace TLS which is
//! per-connection-core-bound. Both configs enable secret extraction so the keys can be
//! exported, and the `CorkStream` wrapper lets `ktls` drain rustls' buffered records
//! cleanly at the handoff.
//!
//! kTLS is a purely *local* optimization — the wire bytes are identical TLS either way,
//! and the two ends decide independently — so a host whose kernel lacks the TLS ULP
//! (the `tls` module) simply keeps userspace `tokio-rustls`. We [`probe_tls_ulp`] once
//! per process and route every handshake to the kTLS or the userspace path accordingly,
//! so a kTLS-less host never wastes a connection discovering it the hard way (this
//! transport is already sensitive to connect-time waste at high fan-out). A kTLS setup
//! that fails at runtime latches the whole process to userspace ([`disable_ktls`]) so
//! we don't retry a path the kernel has already refused. `MM_TCP_KTLS=0` forces the
//! userspace path outright (for debugging or to sidestep a flaky kernel). The three
//! stream flavors — in-kernel and the two userspace half-types — are unified behind
//! [`TlsStream`], over which the pairing prefix and every generic frame flow
//! identically.
//!
//! Everything protocol-independent — establishment, heartbeats (on their own stream),
//! matching serves to joins, side channels, retry/backoff, shutdown — lives in
//! [`crate::net_transport`], generic over [`Net`]. This module supplies only the raw
//! networking. The command loop drives tcp as `NetTransport<Tcp>` (aliased
//! `TcpTransport` in [`crate::ctx`]).
//!
//! ## Streams: one socket each, opened on demand and paired by index
//!
//! A QUIC connection multiplexes its streams (data + heartbeat) on one transport
//! connection; TCP has no multiplexing, so each stream is its own TLS-over-TCP socket.
//! A plain socket can only be opened from the dialing side, so a tcp connection is
//! *directional*: the dialer's [`NetConn::stream`] dials a fresh socket, the acceptor's
//! awaits one. Each socket the dialer opens carries a `(connection_id, stream_index)`
//! prefix. Many logical connections share one listening socket, so a single listener
//! demux pairs each accepted socket with the acceptor-side `stream` request naming the
//! same `(connection_id, index)` — a matcher per pair, dropped as soon as the two halves
//! meet. A socket for stream index 0 (the connection's first stream) surfaces the
//! connection out of [`Net::accept`]; later sockets (the heartbeat stream, or data
//! streams for striping) just pair against their requests.
//!
//! Streams are opened lazily and per index — nothing is pre-opened at connect time — so
//! a message-only side channel opens exactly one socket, and the transport can request a
//! heartbeat or additional data stream whenever it needs one. `priority` is ignored:
//! tcp has no per-stream send priority.
//!
//! ## No transport keepalive
//!
//! A root opens a huge number of connections, so — exactly like the quic side, which
//! disables quinn's PING keep-alive and idle timeout — these sockets must carry **zero**
//! periodic per-connection traffic of their own. We never enable TCP keepalive
//! (`SO_KEEPALIVE`, off by default and left off), and TCP has no idle timeout, so an
//! idle connection stays open sending nothing. Liveness is entirely the heartbeat
//! subsystem's job (its own stream, and delegated so the root's steady-state cost is
//! bounded); a link with no heartbeat obligation — e.g. a delegated one — is genuinely
//! silent, which is what lets the connection count scale.
//!
//! ## Throughput tuning
//!
//! The fast settings that are *safe* to enable everywhere are on by default; the ones
//! whose cost or policy impact scales with the connection count are left opt-in.
//!
//! On by default (safe regardless of scale):
//!
//! - `TCP_NODELAY` — always on: framing flushes per frame, so Nagle would only add
//!   latency.
//! - Congestion control defaults to **BBR**, pinned with `TCP_CONGESTION` *after* the
//!   connection is up — matching the quic transport, which pins BBR unconditionally.
//!   The post-connect timing is deliberate: cross-region flows at Meta have a NetEdit
//!   cgroup eBPF `sockops` force their own CUBIC variant at connect time, overriding
//!   any pre-connect `setsockopt`; a post-connect set sticks. The set is best-effort,
//!   so a host without the `tcp_bbr` module simply keeps the kernel default. Override
//!   with `MM_TCP_CONGESTION` (e.g. `cubic`, or empty to pin nothing).
//! - Listen backlog and `SO_REUSEADDR` on the listener — robustness with negligible
//!   cost.
//!
//! Opt-in (unset ⇒ OS default), because a fixed kernel socket-buffer size both
//! *disables* Linux's per-socket buffer autotuning and — since tcp uses one socket per
//! stream per connection, and a root holds a huge number of connections — multiplies
//! that fixed cost across every socket. Autotuning is the better default at scale;
//! these are for reproducing the cross-region bandwidth ceilings in a bench:
//!
//! - `MM_TCP_SNDBUF_BYTES` / `MM_TCP_RCVBUF_BYTES` — kernel socket-buffer sizes,
//!   set *before* connect/bind so TCP window scaling is negotiated for the enlarged
//!   window (accepted sockets inherit the listener's scale). Requested with the
//!   privileged `SO_*BUFFORCE` options (which bypass `net.core.{r,w}mem_max` under
//!   `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, e.g. as root on MAST) with a fall back to the ordinary setters
//!   otherwise.
