"""
Transfer topologies for the multi-host RDMA benchmark.

A benchmark configuration is a directed graph whose vertices are procs. A
:py:class:`Slot` is one proc, identified by its logical host index and its
*lane* -- the proc's ordinal within its host, which for a GPU run is also its
CUDA device ordinal. An :py:class:`Edge` means bytes move from the source
slot's memory into the destination slot's memory. The graph is built in two
independent steps: :py:func:`host_edges` turns a pattern name and a host count
into a host graph, and :py:func:`expand_lanes` realizes each host edge as proc
edges under a lane-pairing rule.

Which side *initiates* the ibverbs ops is a separate axis. Under ``"write"``
the source pushes into the destination's buffers; under ``"read"`` the
destination pulls from the source's buffers. Both move the same bytes over the
same edges, so a pattern and a direction compose freely.

Memory follows from the graph, and :py:class:`SlotValues` is its shape. A slot
that sends allocates ``concurrent_ops`` *outgoing* tensors, shared by all of its
out-edges: sharing is legal because an ``RDMAAction`` treats a write-from-local
as a *read* claim on local memory and merges overlapping read claims. A slot
that receives allocates that many *incoming* tensors for each peer that sends to
it, and keeping them separate per peer is mandatory: an ``RDMAAction`` does not
track remote ranges, so two initiators writing the same remote buffer would
corrupt it silently. :py:func:`allocation_for` is the single source of truth for
what a slot allocates, so what the actors allocate and what
:py:func:`memory_footprint` charges them for cannot drift.

This module imports only the standard library. It holds no monarch, torch, or
RDMA state, and every function in it is pure, so the whole benchmark's
topology, routing, resource, and validation logic is testable without a
cluster. Buffer handles are opaque: :py:func:`plan_for` and
:py:func:`compare_digests` never look inside them.
