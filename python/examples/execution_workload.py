Execution-surface reproducer.

Brings up a small mesh, exposes the mesh-admin HTTP endpoint, and drives
the ``execution`` introspection surface deterministically over a stdin
command / stdout sentinel handshake. The integration test
(``execution.rs``) is the parent process: it writes commands and waits
for sentinels rather than sleeping.

Actors:

  - ``BusyActor``: holds an invocation per id until it is individually
    released or raised. Its ``hold`` method uses ``@concurrent_endpoint``, so
    ``control`` runs while ``hold`` awaits.
  - an idle sibling ``BusyActor`` that is never invoked.
  - ``QueueActor`` (queue dispatch): a single held invocation shows the
    framework hook also fires in queue mode. Queue dispatch is serialized,
    so a held invocation is never released through a second endpoint call
    (that would deadlock the dispatch loop); the test asserts
    ``count == 1`` then tears the proc down.
  - ``ConcurrentActor``: ``hold`` uses ``@concurrent_endpoint``, so multiple
    held invocations overlap and ``control`` can release them while they wait.
    This covers the pattern used by resource managers.
  - ``deadlock_actor``: a ``QueueActor`` whose blocking plain ``@endpoint``
    ``hold`` monopolizes the Python dispatch loop, so a later ``control``
    release is stuck behind it and can never run -- the failure avoided by
    using ``@concurrent_endpoint``. ``execution.rs`` drives it to prove the
    mesh-admin API surfaces the wedge (``execution.active_count`` stays pinned
    at 1 on the wedged invocation).

Stdin command protocol, one command per line::

    HOLD <actor> <id>     start a held invocation;      prints EXEC_ACK HOLD <id>
    RELEASE <actor> <id>  let a held invocation return; prints EXEC_SENDING then
                          EXEC_ACK release <id>
    RAISE <actor> <id>    make a held invocation raise; prints EXEC_SENDING then
                          EXEC_ACK raise <id>

``<actor>`` is ``busy``, ``queue``, ``concurrent``, or ``deadlock``. Each ``hold`` signals
"entered" from inside the handler body -- after the framework's
``_execution_start`` has recorded the invocation and before the handler
blocks -- so the signal means "mesh-admin now reports this invocation", not
merely "user code started". The signal travels over a monarch ``Port`` rather
than handler stdout: a spawned proc's stdout reaches the client on a
multi-second aggregation window, too coarse for a handshake. The main task
receives on the port and echoes ``EXEC_ENTERED <id>`` to its own unbuffered
stdout.
