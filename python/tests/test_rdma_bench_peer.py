"""
End-to-end tests for the multi-host RDMA benchmark's participant actor.

These drive the sequence the driver will -- ``setup``, ``wire``,
``execute_iteration``, ``digest`` -- against real registered buffers
under ibverbs and tcp.

A single host is enough. The ``shifted`` and ``all`` lane pairings turn a
self-edge into genuine proc-to-proc edges, and ``all`` gives every slot several
peers, which is where per-peer routing can go wrong.
