# Monarch Dashboard

The **Monarch Dashboard** is a web-based GUI for monitoring Monarch actor systems
in real time. It connects to the distributed telemetry system and renders the
full mesh topology — hosts, processes, actor meshes, and individual actors —
across three tabs: **Overview** for live metrics and message traffic,
**Topology** for an interactive job graph, and **Explorer** for drilling into a
single entity.

See the [observability overview](observability) for how the dashboard uses
[distributed telemetry](distributed-telemetry) and complements the
[Mesh Admin TUI](admin-tui).

> **Note** — The Monarch Dashboard is in early development and may change
> significantly between releases.

The dashboard is included in the `torchmonarch` PyPI package. The telemetry
sidecar hosts its query service. Set
`TelemetryConfig(include_dashboard=True)` to advertise the browser UI and print
its URL.

## Quick Start

Start any Monarch application that enables telemetry. The
[**Dining Philosophers**](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch/blob/main/python/examples/dining_philosophers.py)
example is the easiest way to try it — five philosopher actors share chopsticks
around a table, mediated by a waiter actor that prevents deadlock. The
[**Airport Turnaround**](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch/blob/main/python/examples/airport_turnaround_demo.py)
example is a busier alternative — a fleet of flights cycles through turnaround
phases while contending for a small pool of gates, runways, fuel trucks, and
baggage crews. Both accept `--dashboard`.

**Terminal 1** — start the example with the dashboard enabled:

```bash
scripts/run python python/examples/dining_philosophers.py --dashboard
```

The example prints the dashboard URL on startup:

```text
Monarch Dashboard: http://localhost:8265
```

Open [http://localhost:8265](http://localhost:8265) in your browser.

## Overview

The default tab summarizes the whole job. The header persists across tabs,
carrying the tab switcher, a freshness indicator for the live poll, and an
overall health chip.

```

The tab is organized into panels:

- **Metric cards** — host meshes, proc meshes, actors (split into workload and
  system), messages over the retention window, handler success rate, and the
  health score.
- **System Health** — a gauge scoring the workload actors. System actors are
  excluded, and the caption reports how many.
- **Message Activity** — throughput across the retention window, annotated with
  the sampled time range. Viewing the dashboard itself adds a little `scan`
  traffic, which the panel notes.
- **Actor Status** — a donut of the current state of every actor, with a legend
  per status.
- **Errors & Failures** — failed and stopped actors with their reasons, or a
  clean bill of health.
- **Message Traffic** — the handler lifecycle (queued → active →
  completed / failed) and a ranked list of message volume by endpoint. These
  are handler states, not delivery kinds.
- **Actor Fleet** — one chip per workload actor showing its role, proc, and
  live status; click a chip to inspect it. Toggle **Show System** to include
  system actors.
- **Topology Breakdown** — counts and proportions of host, proc, and actor
  meshes.

## Topology

The Topology tab renders the job as an interactive directed graph. Solid edges
are the mesh hierarchy; dashed edges are message flow between actors, rolled up
to whichever nodes are currently visible.

Two view modes trade detail against legibility. Switch between them with the
leftmost toolbar button.

### Actors view

One node per entity — host, proc, and actor — each tagged with its mesh. Use
this to follow individual actors and see which of them talk to each other.

```text
Host → Proc → Actor
```

```{image} _static/dashboard-dag.png
:alt: Topology tab in Actors view, fully expanded, showing a host and a controller above six procs and their philosopher and waiter actors, with dashed message edges

```

### Meshes view

Each host, proc, and actor mesh collapses to a single node carrying its member
count. This keeps larger and more complex jobs clear: rather than hundreds of
individual actors, the graph shows only the meshes and the relationships
between them.

```{image} _static/dashboard-dag-meshes.png
:alt: Topology tab in Meshes view, fully expanded, showing two host meshes above two proc meshes and two actor meshes, each labeled with its member count
:width: 100%
```

Both modes share the same controls:

- **Expand All** and **Collapse** open or close every level. A collapsed node
  reports how many descendants it hides.
- **Show System** brings in the system actors, which are hidden by default.
- **Top-Down** and **Left-Right** flip the layout direction; **Fit** frames the
  graph. **Auto-fit** re-frames on a structural change but never on a live
  refresh, so it leaves a manual zoom alone.
- **Pan** by dragging the canvas, and **zoom** with the scroll wheel, the zoom
  buttons, or the minimap.
- **Hover** a node for its name, type, status, mesh, and reference. **Click** an
  actor to open its detail drawer; clicking a node that has children expands or
  collapses it instead.
- Nodes are colored by status. The legend keys those colors, the mesh colors,
  and the two kinds of edge.

## Explorer

The Explorer pairs a hierarchy tree with a detail pane. Filter the tree by
name, expand or collapse every level, and toggle **Show System** to include
system actors.

```{image} _static/dashboard-hierarchy.png
:alt: Explorer tab showing the hierarchy tree on the left and an actor detail pane on the right with a breadcrumb, actor info, and a status timeline
:width: 100%
```

```text
Controller (the client host)
Host
  └─ Proc
       └─ Actor
```

Every row is tagged with its mesh and carries a status dot. Hosts and procs
also report how many actors sit below them.

### Entity detail

Selecting a host or proc reports its name, mesh, status, direct child count,
the number of actors below it, and its reference, followed by a rollup of the
statuses below it and a list of its children.

### Actor detail

Selecting an actor shows a breadcrumb of its ancestors and four sections:

- **Py-spy** — capture a live stack trace. Sampling is proc-level, so a dump
  covers every actor sharing that Python process.
- **Actor info** — full name, ID, rank, mesh, current status, and creation
  timestamp.
- **Status timeline** — the most recent status transitions, with timestamps.
- **Messages** — incoming and outgoing messages with peer, endpoint, and
  status. Click a row to expand its status event history.

## Programmatic Usage

Here is an example of how to enable the dashboard on your job via the [Jobs API](api/monarch.job).

```python
from monarch.job import ProcessJob, TelemetryConfig

job = ProcessJob({"workers": 2}).enable_telemetry(
    TelemetryConfig(include_dashboard=True, dashboard_port=8265)
)
state = job.state(cached_path=None)
print(state.dashboard_url)
```

`enable_telemetry()` also starts mesh admin and periodic introspection
snapshots. Use `state.query_engine_client` to query the same data directly; see
[Distributed Telemetry](distributed-telemetry).
